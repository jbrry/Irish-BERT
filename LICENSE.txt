       revocable licence to use the Software for non-commercial

         1. not to use the Software for commercial purposes;
         2. not to translate the Software into any computer
            language aside from the current source code language;
            and
         3. not to rent, lease, sub-license or loan the Software.

   Obligations
    4. You undertake and warrant:
         1. To reference your use of the Software in any
            publications or academic research which is based or
            partly based on findings obtained using the Software
            including where the Software is used to gather data or
            information used in such publications or academic
            research. Your obligations under this clause will be
            met where you include wording along the following
            lines in your publication or academic research:
            “[Software Name, Version] used under licence from
            ADAPT at Dublin City University through SF I Grant
            Number 13/RC/2106”.
         2. Any additions, updates, amendments, modifications,
            adaptions or improvements which you make to all or
            part of the source code of the Software (including but
            not limited to the use of application programming
            interfaces (API’s)) (“Improvements”) will
            automatically be owned by Licensor. To the extent that
            they are not automatically owned by DCU, you hereby
            irrevocably assign all Improvements to DCU.

   Intellectual property rights
    5. You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in
       the Software throughout the world belong to the Licensor,
       that rights in the Software are licensed (not sold) to you,
       and that you have no rights in, or to, the Software other
       than the right to use them in accordance with the terms of
       this Licence.

   No Warranty
    6. You acknowledge that any the Software is provided to you on
       an "as is" basis now and in the future. All conditions,
       warranties or other terms which might have effect between
       the parties or be implied or incorporated into this licence
       or any collateral contract, whether by statute, common law
       or otherwise, are hereby excluded to the maximum extent
       permitted by law, including the implied conditions,
       warranties or other terms as to satisfactory quality,
       fitness for purpose or the use of reasonable skill and care
       in the preparation of the Software.
    7. You acknowledge that the Software may not be free of errors
       or bugs. DCU has no obligation to support or update the
       Software in any way.

   Limitation of Liability
    8. You acknowledge that the Software has not been developed to
       meet your individual requirements and that it is therefore
       your responsibility to ensure that the facilities and
       functions of the Software meet your requirements.
    9. We shall not under any circumstances whatever be liable to
       you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence),
       breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, arising under or in
       connection with the Licence for loss of profits, sales,
       business, or revenue, business interruption, loss of
       anticipated savings, loss or corruption of data or
       information, loss of business opportunity, goodwill or
       reputation or any indirect or consequential loss or damage.
   10. Other than the losses set out in term 9 (for which we are
       not liable), our maximum aggregate liability under or in
       connection with this Licence whether in contract, tort
       (including negligence) or otherwise, shall in all
       circumstances be limited to a sum equal to the total fees
       paid by the Licensee to DCU. This maximum cap does not
       apply to term 11.
   11. Nothing in this Licence shall limit or exclude our
       liability for death or personal injury resulting from our
       negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or any
       other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by Irish
       law.
   12. This Licence sets out the full extent of our obligations
       and liabilities in respect of the supply of the Software.
       Except as expressly stated in this Licence, there are no
       conditions, warranties, representations or other terms,
       express or implied, that are binding on us. Any condition,
       warranty, representation or other term concerning the
       supply of the Software which might otherwise be implied
       into, or incorporated in, this Licence whether by statute,
       common law or otherwise, is excluded to the fullest extent
       permitted by law.

   Termination
   13. We may terminate this Licence immediately by written notice
       to you if you commit a breach of this Licence which you
       fail to remedy (if remediable) within 14 days after the
       service on you of written notice requiring you to do so.
   14. Upon termination for any reason:
         1. all rights granted to you under this Licence shall
            cease;
         2. you must cease all activities authorised by this
            Licence; and
         3. you must immediately delete or remove the Software
            from all computer equipment in your possession or
            under your control.

   Other Important Terms
   15. We may transfer our rights and obligations under this
       Licence to another organisation, but this will not affect
       your rights or our obligations under this Licence.
   16. You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under
       this Licence to another person if you obtain our prior
       consent in writing to do so.
   17. This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between you
       and us. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any
       statement, promise or representation made or given by or on
       behalf of us which is not set out in this Licence.
   18. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your
       obligations under this Licence, or if we do not enforce our
       rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will
       not mean that we have waived our rights against you and
       will not mean that you do not have to comply with those
       obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only
       do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will
       automatically waive any later default by you.
   19. Each of the conditions of this Licence operates separately.
       If any court or competent authority decides that any of
       them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining
       conditions will remain in full force and effect.
   20. This Licence, its subject matter and its formation, are
       governed by Irish law. You and we both agree to that the
       courts of Ireland will have exclusive jurisdiction.
