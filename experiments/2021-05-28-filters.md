# Analysis of Various Filters

In the experiments below, the four filtering settings are compared: `None`, `Document-Heuristic`, `OpusFilter-Basic` and `OpusFilter-Basic+Char+Lang`.
A BERT model is trained on the sentences which remain after applying each filter for 500k steps, apart from `OpusFilter-Basic+Char+Lang` which only reached 453/500k steps before reaching the job time limit of 48 hours
